# HA isometric animated picture card
 Tiny custom cards that let Home-Assistant picture-elements play WebM loops and frame-accurate videos whose speed or frame instantly follows any entity state (0-100 % or presets)

# üè° Animated Room Card for Home-Assistant

A photo-real **isometric room** that reacts to your smart-home entities:
blinds glide smoothly to any %, the ceiling-fan spins at live speed,
and everything runs client-side with two tiny JavaScript cards.
